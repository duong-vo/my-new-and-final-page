- Contrary to my estimation, STB is still rising strong despite the tariff uncertainty, I already liquidate half of my position so there is no good reentry point, but again, conservative is better and it's still a month before everything plays out on July 9th
- I will look at VTO more in depth today and try to understand its business and is there any room for growth or any value can be achieved from it.
    - So the big thesis is that this company is sitting on a huge 900 bil cash pile. There are other lots of strong business sign, corporate buyback, never missed a dividends, as well as a strong free cash flow history, always postive and healthy at around 200 bil for the past 7 years. But the key value is this cash pile, cash often does not mean anything for growth, but its a good estimation of the company current value. From what I read it seems that this cash will be used to buy a new ship without using any debt, which in turn means that revenue will likely grow and contribute to the dividend yield (if the stock price stay the same). Again as a value investor, I'm looking to compound more than the market, at 9% a year for 3 years, that is likely better in the short term than the overall market. So with this value of 9% the stock most likely will be traded at around 16,000 for the next year, not a huge, huge compounding but I guess it's the best I could find right now and I should just invest when the opportunity arise.
