- Sass business, then and now. In the past, software business is more geared towards one time fee (i.e $500 for a microsoft office), now however, most software is on a subscription model, which is much more sustainable as well as stable revenue (i.e Google Docs). LTV of each software is 1 / Churn rate, Customer Acquistion Cost is the cost in order to spent on each customer (i.e marketing, benefits, cost of capital), if a Sass business have this ratio is less than 1, then it's a bad business. Good companies like Amazon or Spotify will have a huge LTV and CAC.
    - Net New MRR: the incremental dollars add to install base each month. Basically how much the business is growing. These incremental dollar formula is something similar to: New MRR (New Customers) + Upgrade MRR (Existing Customers) - Downgrade MRR (Existing Customer downgrade product) - Cancellation MRR (Lost Custoemrs). This need to be continualy positive for the company to grow. However, MRR is an internal tool and it's not a really public number.
