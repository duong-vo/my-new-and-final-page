- News came out that the fish product that a company I'm tracking that is exporting Striped catfish may be able to suffer no tariff, but there is no name from the company I'm targeting. I wasn't able to get a good price for it because it's been trading so thinly, but I will buying in today as well since the liquidation value is around 10k, which is basically 2/3 of the price.
