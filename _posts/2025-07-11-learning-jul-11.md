The market has risen approximately 16% year to date, and I did not fully capitalize on it because I already half every single position since my tariff judgement is that I could lose 10 to 20% and could probably make around 5 - 10% if the market move right. Turns out it's around 15%. I thought I should've thought about it more carefully, but anyway, I'm wrong and I miss the opportunity to make some more money, but also I preserve a lot of money rather than lose it permanent, so even though I did not make more, I did not lose it. But is there any chance I could have revised my decision and bought more? I guess not, the moment I sell, it's impossible to buy back unless there is a huge thing happen, so I guess I should not give my position so easily? Even if I revise my thesis, it's impossible to buy back anyway.
