- My STB position balloon to 20% return now but with only half of my capital, anyway it's a special situation stock and it's not my idea so it's kinda hard to know when to buy and when to exit, but I can kinda understand the stock where we just need a dividend yield to kick in and it will balloon in value.
- AAM drops yesterday which gives me a place to buy into it, I will again consider it a little bit more before buying
- One of the stock I once aimed at is HSL whose just rise over nearly 30% in a few days, this is also a Graham kind of stock and it behaves similar to FCM. I wonder if I did any computation on it in the past. Not much but it's also a Graham type of play
