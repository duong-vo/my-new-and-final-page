Read through Greenblatt and he is the modern type of Graham that instead of focusing on net net (company that trades below liquidation value). As Greenblatt says, it's very rare nowadays and instead he suggest another formula which focus on high ROIC (return on capital, low investment, high return basically), and we can get them for cheap (low P/E rate). I don't know what's the margin of safety for this even though he mentioned margin of safety a lot. But I have compiled a list that fits on to his criteria and here are the best [stocks](evernote:///view/246850237/s432/c8bb8aae-bcb6-6699-9da5-079705cd8b5b#a7759ecc-0753-4b10-ab81-3e9e3eb47d4c/775bbfcb-d458-491f-ac8e-da9bcb6afb69).
