- I will look through some of the best performing stock in the past 10 years to see what's the business pattern. But again, is this even the right way to do it? I'm buying on margin of safety, not looking for growth or the best perofrming business because you need a lot of things go right to achieve that growth. I'm strictly using a value play, meaning a distressed company, not a business that grow exponetially. Well, I can look through the numbers and see but not look at the growth driving things.
    - Unfortunately, this is not an organic growing business with cash flows and reinvest and the low capital expenditure and all that. Firstly they 10x their revenue just because they combine revenue with another company (and the government allow it), and then the price of their product rise which is not a value investment type, so I will not invest in this company even though it's best performing in the last 10 years.
