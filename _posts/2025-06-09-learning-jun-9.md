- Market lost 20 points which is expected but still no opportunity arises from it. I'm still trying to look through some predictable and cheap business that I can invest in as a value play but still not that fruitful. Some stocks I've looked through:
    - VTO, extremely cash rich, however it operate in the oil transportation business which is extremely unpredictable and cyclical. With uncertainties in the market, buying in right now will often not yield any good result. When I say cash rich, it means extremely cash rich, 900 bil in cash with 990 bil valuation and little capex in the past 2 years. Debt payment has been steady. I think I can look at this further in the coming days to come up with a thesis
    - VPG, stock drops 5 days in a row due to arrest of its CEO and chairman. Very cash rich, sitting on 1600 bil while valued at 700 bil. However, very debt heavy, over 4000 bil in short term debt and no past debt repayment, so if I'm not mistaken, this should be a case of debt restructuring if I want to unlock a profit
    - HAH, this stock manage to return over 1500% in 5 years, and this is a classic Peter Lynch play where a business is growing at 30 - 40% CAGR, extremely rare. This only helps if you know the business and know that it can expand successfully, which I would have no way of knowing, especially if the business of port and transport. I guess it's because the boom in logistic during 2020 - 2022 period and this company caught the tailwind of it, looking through the numbers, it's because the company managed to boost its earnings. Moreover, it recently surges because business try to import as much as possible during the tariff pause, which generate a lot of money for the business. So that's a small catalyst, not a value play.
