- So my calculation is wrong, Vietnam finally manage to lock in a trade deal with the US and only a 20%, so I missed a lot of money made and this is a mistake on my part to give up my positions so easily. Although I could be right and stocks drop, I could use the previous position and add more to my position, and trim off a little bit rather than half. This again is a lesson that I should never give up my position so easily if all of my value are not realized. As Buffett says, I'd rather a bumpy 15% rather than a smooth 12%
