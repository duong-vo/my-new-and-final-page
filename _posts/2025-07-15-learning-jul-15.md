I read through some of the Greenblatt lecture and valuation and I'm most of the time confused, which is a good sign that there's more thing to learn about and I'm not at the end of the road in term of picking stocks. He talks about valuation but I still don't quite get all of what he's saying as well as his case studies. He also involves a lot scuttlebutting which I don't know how to get start. But just number crunching and small business I guess is enough for reasonably well investing.
Greenblatt is definitely a Buffett type of investor where he focus on compounding and good business that can grow compared to typical roadkill stock like me and Michael Burry operate. I mean road kill stock are easy and I've found relative success in them like FCM, however, I can't hold them for too long or find a multi bagger and I could expand on my skills to find these companies that can grow 10 times in 10 years. All of the company that is the top of his criteria all are multi baggers over the years and I can use this to further analyze. Also what's my competence and business that I can understand, oil business definitely not, consumer and retail have a bunch of tricky inventory and stuff like that so no, technology I'm in it, but Vietnam are all outsourced projects so no point in there so now I'm literally relied on metrics and general business knowledge.
